      <p class="tagline">When Love Burns Brighter Than the Darkness.</p>

      <div class="book-description">
        <p><strong>Some love stories are written in fire. Others are carved into skin.</strong></p>
        <p>Colton Bennett was born to be a rockstar—tattoos, talent, and a temper the world loved to hate. But behind the stage lights and headlines is a man unraveling quietly. Drowning in expectations. Haunted by pain no one ever sees.</p>
        <p>Nikki Thomas was never meant to be visible. Not to the world. Not to him. Hidden behind a pen name and a brutal past, she was just supposed to help manage his life—not rewrite it. But she was Phoenix long before she was Nikki. And he was hers before he ever knew it.</p>
        <p>What began as anonymous letters turns into a connection neither of them are ready for—raw, messy, and addictive. But when secrets come out and danger closes in, love stops being a fairytale. It becomes survival. And in the fire between them, only one truth remains:</p>
        <p>He is the chaos she never saw coming.</p>
        <p>She is the quiet he’ll burn the world to keep.</p>
        <p>And together, they’re the match the past never saw coming.</p>
        <p><em>Twin Flame</em> is a dark, emotional romance about trauma, obsession, and the kind of love that doesn’t heal you—it brands you. Forever.</p>
