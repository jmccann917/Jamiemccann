ðŸ“š First-Time Author. Long-Time Story Hoarder.

Hi, reader friends ðŸ‘‹

So... this is my first blog post ever. Not just as an authorâ€”but like, ever. And I still donâ€™t think itâ€™s fully hit me that Iâ€™ve released my debut novel into the world.

What started as a late-night whisper in my head, a mess of notes in my phone, and characters that refused to let me sleep... is now a real book. *Twin Flame* lives on shelves, in Kindles, and hopefully in the hearts of readers who like their love stories a little haunted.

Writing this novel was more than telling a storyâ€”it was building a world, bleeding a little onto every page, and finding beauty in the wreckage. If youâ€™re already reading it, thank you. And if youâ€™re new hereâ€”hi. Iâ€™m glad you found your way in.

What to Expect Around Here: Behind-the-scenes chaos. Book updates. Characters who won't leave me alone. Sneak peeks. Occasional emotional spirals. And the kind of stories that hurt a little before they heal.

This space wonâ€™t be polishedâ€”but itâ€™ll be real. And honest. And a little messy. Just like the stories I write. Every story I write burns a little.

Follow me to stay up to date on all things *Twin Flame* and whatâ€™s coming next.

Until then â€”  
**Jamie McCann**  
Author of *Twin Flame* ðŸ”¥
