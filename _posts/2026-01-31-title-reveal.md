New book coming soon!! 🖤  

This story is close. Like… actually close.

It has lived in drafts and notes for a long time, but now it is finally taking its final shape. And it felt like the right time to say its name out loud.

My next book is called Bound by the Hollow.

This is a dark fantasy romance—quietly intense, a little dangerous, and deeply emotional. It is the kind of story that unfolds slowly, lets tension build, and trusts the reader to feel what is happening between the lines.

The Hollow is not something I want to explain too much yet. Some things are better discovered as you read. What I can say is that this story is about connection, choice, and the way certain moments alter the course of everything that comes after.

I am keeping most details close for now, but I am very excited about where this book has landed—and even more excited that it is nearly ready.

And if all goes well, I am hoping to share a cover reveal very soon.

Thank you for being here, for reading, and for caring about the stories I am bringing into the world. It truly means more than I can say.

Until then—  
Jamie McCann
