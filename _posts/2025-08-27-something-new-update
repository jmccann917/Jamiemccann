Hi, reader friends ðŸ–¤  

The ink hasnâ€™t even dried on *Twin Flame*, and already Iâ€™ve been deep in the shadows of my next story. Itâ€™s a brand-new standalone, and while Iâ€™m keeping the title under wraps for now, I can promise itâ€™s shaping up to be darker, sharper, and every bit as consuming.  

I canâ€™t share too much yet, but here are a few whispers from the pages so far:  

- Moonlight, secrets, and a bond that refuses to break.  
- A heroine caught between the magic she fears and the love she craves.  
- A world where fate and power collide, and the cost of both is everything.  

Iâ€™m working hard behind the scenes to bring this story to life, and I canâ€™t wait until the moment I can finally share the cover, the name, and the first official look with you.  

For now, just know: itâ€™s coming. And itâ€™s going to be worth the wait.
