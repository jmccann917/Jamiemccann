    <p>Fueled by coffee, chaos, and a heart that beats for stories that ache, I write romance on the dark side—where love is messy, characters are haunted, and happily-ever-afters are earned through fire.</p>
    <p>I’m a wife, a mom, and a full-time daydreamer who lives for those quiet moments when books feel like secrets and music says everything I cannot.</p>
    <p><em>Twin Flame</em> was born from a single, haunting moment—a psychic once told me my husband was my twin flame, and that idea never let me go. It sank into my bones, twisted through every shadow I carry, and lit the spark for a story about a love so fierce it destroys and rebuilds.</p>
    <p>Like the phoenix I’ve always loved, my characters rise from ruin—scarred, stronger, and unrelenting.</p>
    <p>My stories are dark, emotional, and tangled with suspense. They’re about resilience, survival, and finding beauty in the broken. About the kind of love that doesn’t run from darkness—but walks straight into it, willingly.</p>
    <p>When I’m not writing, I’m tangled in the beautiful chaos of family life, singing way too passionately to songs that understand me, and dreaming up the next story that’ll break your heart—before piecing it back together again.</p>
